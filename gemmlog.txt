I have this triton kernel and am trying to understand the memory access patterns of the kernel, and where there is memory locality that can be taken advantage of in the hardware cache. I will use this to swizzle the block id to better align the work so we have better cache locality.

I DO NOT want you to rewrite any code. I only want you to give me an overview for the memory access patterns and memory locality of the kernel. This will be used as context for future prompts that will take advantage of your insights. Make sure these insights on memory access patterns and locality between blocks in the kernel are accuracy and insightful so that I can actually take advantage of them to improve locality.

   - **Matrix A and B:** The kernel accesses these matrices in blocks, with `A_BASE` and `B_BASE` calculated using indices `rm`, `rn`, and `rk`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests alignment efforts for better cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C:** The result is stored in blocks, with access determined by `C_` using `rm` and `rn`. Masks ensure only valid elements are written, handling edge cases.
   - **Bias:** Accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`, straightforward due to single-dimensional access.

2. **Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** Maximized by accessing contiguous memory blocks, ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Limited due to independent block processing, but accumulation in `acc` may offer some benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** Controlled via `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers, and `tl.debug_barrier` for synchronization.

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Consider swizzling block IDs (e.g., Z-order or Hilbert curve) to enhance cache locality.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching into shared memory or registers could hide memory latency, especially for large matrices.

These insights can guide optimizations to improve cache performance and overall efficiency of the kernel.
[INTELLIPERF] DEBUG: Memory analysis reasoning: The `streamk_gemm` kernel is a matrix multiplication operation with additional features like bias addition and handling of non-even dimensions. The kernel is designed to work on blocks of matrices A, B, and C, with specific block sizes defined by `BLOCK_SIZE_M`, `BLOCK_SIZE_N`, and `BLOCK_SIZE_K`. The memory access patterns are crucial for understanding how data is loaded and stored, which directly impacts performance due to cache utilization.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B Access:** The kernel accesses matrix A and B in blocks. For matrix A, the access pattern is determined by `A_BASE`, which is calculated using the row indices `rm` and column indices `rk`. Similarly, for matrix B, `B_BASE` is calculated using `rk` and `rn`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests an attempt to align memory accesses to improve cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C Access:** The result of the matrix multiplication is stored in matrix C. The access pattern for C is determined by `C_`, which is calculated using `rm` and `rn`. The use of masks ensures that only valid elements are written, which is important for handling edge cases where the block size does not perfectly divide the matrix dimensions.
   - **Bias Access:** If bias is used, it is accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`. This access pattern is straightforward as it involves a single dimension.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel attempts to maximize spatial locality by accessing contiguous blocks of memory. This is evident in the use of `tl.arange` and the block-based approach, which ensures that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Temporal locality is less pronounced in this kernel since each block of the matrix is processed independently. However, the use of shared memory (if any) and the accumulation of results in `acc` can provide some temporal locality benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** The kernel uses `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers like `.wt` and `.cv`, which suggest an attempt to control cache behavior explicitly. The use of `tl.debug_barrier` indicates synchronization points that might be used to ensure data consistency across threads.

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By analyzing the access patterns, one could consider swizzling the block IDs to improve cache locality. For instance, processing blocks in a Z-order curve or a Hilbert curve might improve cache performance by keeping related data closer in memory.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching of data into shared memory or registers could be considered to hide memory latency, especially for large matrices where global memory access is a bottleneck.

Overall, the kernel is designed to take advantage of block-based processing to improve memory access patterns, but there might be opportunities to further optimize cache utilization through block swizzling and prefetching strategies.

The memory analysis is: The `streamk_gemm` kernel exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged to improve performance:

1. **Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B:** The kernel accesses these matrices in blocks, with `A_BASE` and `B_BASE` calculated using indices `rm`, `rn`, and `rk`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests alignment efforts for better cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C:** The result is stored in blocks, with access determined by `C_` using `rm` and `rn`. Masks ensure only valid elements are written, handling edge cases.
   - **Bias:** Accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`, straightforward due to single-dimensional access.

2. **Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** Maximized by accessing contiguous memory blocks, ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Limited due to independent block processing, but accumulation in `acc` may offer some benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** Controlled via `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers, and `tl.debug_barrier` for synchronization.

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Consider swizzling block IDs (e.g., Z-order or Hilbert curve) to enhance cache locality.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching into shared memory or registers could hide memory latency, especially for large matrices.

These insights can guide optimizations to improve cache performance and overall efficiency of the kernel.

Pay special attention to the swizzling pattern in the diff. If you see a swizzling pattern in the diff, do not reimplement it. Instead, try to implement an completely new approach to swizzling.On the MI300x GPU there are multiple XCDs, and each XCD has its own L2 cache. So that blocks on the same XCD that access the same memory will likely hit in the shared L2 cache and thus improve the L2 hit rate of the program. For this reason, blocks that share the same data should be scheduled to the same XCD. Your task is to find the swizzling formulation such that blocks that access the same memory will be scheduled to the same XCD.

MI300X architecture specification

The GPU contains 8 XCDs.

Each XCD has its own L2 cache.

XCDs contain multiple Compute Units (CUs) and blocks are assigned to CUs.

We want to maximize utilization by assigning an equal number of blocks to each XCD.

HIP runtime scheduling of blocks:

By default, the hardware scheduler assigns each incoming block, in order, to XCDs in a cyclic ("round-robin") sequence:

// pseudocode for default mapping for each block in [0, num_blocks):

assigned_xcd = block % num_XCDs; // execute old_blockIdx on XCD assigned_xcd

Once it reaches XCD num_XCD–1, it "wraps around" and continues assigning the next blocks to XCD 0, then XCD 1, and so on.

If there are more blocks than XCDs, the scheduler effectively makes multiple "rounds," each of size num_XCD.

Swizzling goal

Recompute the block index with the old block index, number of XCDs on the GPU, and total number of blocks in the program so that:

Blocks that share the same data map to the same XCD until that XCD's share is filled.

Work remains evenly balanced across XCDs.

We want to understand how the blocks are strided by the round robin scheduler. Some question that you might want to ask (but might not necessarily be relevant) are: How do you calculate the XCD id that the block was originally mapped to? How many blocks are in each XCD/ How do you understand the stride of block indexes. If we have to round robin for multiple iterations, how do we calculate the number of iterations that the block index was assigned on? How can we use this to make an offset for reassigning the block index.

There are potentially many more question that you might want to ask when understanding how to best swizzle the kernel to take advantage of locality. To be very clear, the optimal swizzling pattern will change by algorithm. Different algorithms reuse data differently, and thus the blocks that should share the same L2 cache will change by different algorithms based on memory access patterns. I want you to deeply understand how to do this for the specific algorithm we are working on.

I want you to consider the swizzling pattern step by step and then put everything together in the formula.

Task

num_XCD = 8 in this hardware architecture. In the case of this program, num_blocks is equal to num_SMS, so you can directly use that argument. Make sure you do not change the parameters in the kernel function, as this will break the code. The function signature must stay exactly the same or the code will fail.

Propose a swizzling pattern as one or a few lines of code inside the kernel that reassigns the block index. For HIP kernels, you must still eventually assign threadId. For the HIP kernels, also make sure that you use the new swizzled block ids for all thread id computation. For Triton kernels, you must still eventually assign pid. Rewrite the code of the entire kernel without putting in any placeholders. I want to be able to take the code, copy it into a new file, and run it on the testbench without any extra work. Again, make sure to not change the kernel function signature and only add new swizzling lines within the kernel using the available parameters.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Make sure that you keep trying to push the performance of the kernel with your swizzling pattern. It is possible for the implementation to be faster, so try to find this.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Do not include any markdown code blocks or text other than the code. DO NOT start the code with 'python'. I want you to straight directly output the code. I want to be able to copy and paste the code into a new file and run it on the testbench without any extra work.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Make sure to try new approaches to swizzling. Do not just use the same approach as the previous time. If you have previously tried an approach and it is shown in the diff, do not reimplement it. Instead, try to implement an completely new approach to swizzling.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Make sure to not change the kernel function signature. Do not add any new parameters to the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - I always want the original pid to be written to a variable called pid and ending in a variable called pid. If we have a 2D grid of pids, they must be called pid_x and pid_y, and so on. It is very important that you name the variables by this format and write the whole code based around these variable names so that it runs successfully.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Make sure your output is in the correct format. The fields are reason_why_old_was_slow, summary_of_optimization, reason_why_new_should_be_better, result_code, and swizzling_pattern.
[INTELLIPERF] DEBUG: Optimization reasoning: The original kernel code uses a straightforward block assignment strategy, which does not take full advantage of the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs and their associated L2 caches. By default, blocks are assigned in a round-robin fashion across XCDs, which can lead to suboptimal cache utilization when blocks that access the same data are spread across different XCDs. This can result in increased memory latency and reduced performance due to poor cache locality.
