--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged to improve performance:

1. **Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B:** The kernel accesses these matrices in blocks, with `A_BASE` and `B_BASE` calculated using indices `rm`, `rn`, and `rk`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests alignment efforts for better cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C:** The result is stored in blocks, with access determined by `C_` using `rm` and `rn`. Masks ensure only valid elements are written, handling edge cases.
   - **Bias:** Accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`, straightforward due to single-dimensional access.

2. **Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** Maximized by accessing contiguous memory blocks, ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Limited due to independent block processing, but accumulation in `acc` may offer some benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** Controlled via `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers, and `tl.debug_barrier` for synchronization.

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Consider swizzling block IDs (e.g., Z-order or Hilbert curve) to enhance cache locality.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching into shared memory or registers could hide memory latency, especially for large matrices.

These insights can guide optimizations to improve cache performance and overall efficiency of the kernel.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel is a matrix multiplication operation with additional features like bias addition and handling of non-even dimensions. The kernel is designed to work on blocks of matrices A, B, and C, with specific block sizes defined by `BLOCK_SIZE_M`, `BLOCK_SIZE_N`, and `BLOCK_SIZE_K`. The memory access patterns are crucial for understanding how data is loaded and stored, which directly impacts performance due to cache utilization.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B Access:** The kernel accesses matrix A and B in blocks. For matrix A, the access pattern is determined by `A_BASE`, which is calculated using the row indices `rm` and column indices `rk`. Similarly, for matrix B, `B_BASE` is calculated using `rk` and `rn`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests an attempt to align memory accesses to improve cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C Access:** The result of the matrix multiplication is stored in matrix C. The access pattern for C is determined by `C_`, which is calculated using `rm` and `rn`. The use of masks ensures that only valid elements are written, which is important for handling edge cases where the block size does not perfectly divide the matrix dimensions.
   - **Bias Access:** If bias is used, it is accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`. This access pattern is straightforward as it involves a single dimension.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel attempts to maximize spatial locality by accessing contiguous blocks of memory. This is evident in the use of `tl.arange` and the block-based approach, which ensures that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Temporal locality is less pronounced in this kernel since each block of the matrix is processed independently. However, the use of shared memory (if any) and the accumulation of results in `acc` can provide some temporal locality benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** The kernel uses `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers like `.wt` and `.cv`, which suggest an attempt to control cache behavior explicitly. The use of `tl.debug_barrier` indicates synchronization points that might be used to ensure data consistency across threads.

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By analyzing the access patterns, one could consider swizzling the block IDs to improve cache locality. For instance, processing blocks in a Z-order curve or a Hilbert curve might improve cache performance by keeping related data closer in memory.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching of data into shared memory or registers could be considered to hide memory latency, especially for large matrices where global memory access is a bottleneck.

Overall, the kernel is designed to take advantage of block-based processing to improve memory access patterns, but there might be opportunities to further optimize cache utilization through block swizzling and prefetching strategies.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code uses a straightforward block assignment strategy, which does not take full advantage of the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs and their associated L2 caches. By default, blocks are assigned in a round-robin fashion across XCDs, which can lead to suboptimal cache utilization when blocks that access the same data are spread across different XCDs. This can result in increased memory latency and reduced performance due to poor cache locality.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the architecture's multiple XCDs and their separate L2 caches, leading to poor cache locality as blocks accessing the same data were not guaranteed to be scheduled on the same XCD."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This is achieved by computing a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The goal is to maximize cache locality by ensuring that blocks sharing data are scheduled on the same XCD, while also balancing the workload across all XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve performance by enhancing cache locality. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, the L2 cache hit rate is increased, reducing memory latency. Additionally, the workload is evenly distributed across all XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck. This balanced approach should lead to better overall utilization of the GPU's resources and improved kernel performance.

Swizzling formula:
# Swizzling pattern to map blocks to XCDs
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    assigned_xcd = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_offset = (pid // NUM_XCDS) * NUM_XCDS
    pid = assigned_xcd * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS) + round_robin_offset + (pid % (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS))
