--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged for optimization:

1. **Matrix A and B Access:**
   - The kernel accesses matrices A and B in a block-wise manner, with each block being processed in chunks of `BLOCK_SIZE_K`. This access pattern is conducive to spatial locality, as contiguous memory locations are accessed within each block.

2. **Matrix C Access:**
   - The result matrix C is updated in blocks, with each block corresponding to a tile of the output matrix. This ensures that the updates to C are localized, which can improve cache efficiency.

3. **Bias Access:**
   - If bias is enabled, the bias vector is accessed in alignment with the rows of matrix A, ensuring that the bias values are reused efficiently across multiple iterations.

4. **Spatial and Temporal Locality:**
   - The kernel exhibits strong spatial locality due to the contiguous access patterns within each block. Temporal locality is achieved through the reuse of the `acc` variable, which accumulates partial results over multiple iterations.

5. **Inter-Block Locality:**
   - The processing of blocks can lead to cache thrashing if not managed properly. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` functions helps align memory accesses to improve cache utilization.

6. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Reordering the processing of blocks can enhance cache locality by ensuring that blocks likely to be used together are loaded into the cache simultaneously.
   - **Stride Management:** Ensuring positive and consistent strides for all matrices helps maintain predictable and aligned memory accesses, which is crucial for cache efficiency.

By understanding these memory access patterns and locality characteristics, it is possible to optimize the kernel for better cache performance, potentially through techniques like block swizzling and careful management of memory access patterns.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel is a matrix multiplication operation with optional bias addition, implemented using Triton. The kernel is designed to handle large matrices by dividing them into smaller blocks, which are processed in parallel. Understanding the memory access patterns and locality is crucial for optimizing performance, especially in terms of cache usage.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B Access:** The kernel accesses matrices A and B in blocks of size `BLOCK_SIZE_M x BLOCK_SIZE_K` and `BLOCK_SIZE_K x BLOCK_SIZE_N`, respectively. The access pattern is primarily determined by the loop over `k`, which iterates over the K dimension in chunks of `BLOCK_SIZE_K`.
   - **Matrix C Access:** The result matrix C is updated in blocks of size `BLOCK_SIZE_M x BLOCK_SIZE_N`. The final result is stored in C after accumulating the partial results in the `acc` variable.
   - **Bias Access:** If bias is enabled, the bias vector is accessed in a manner aligned with the rows of matrix A.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel exhibits spatial locality by accessing contiguous memory locations within each block. This is evident in the way blocks of A, B, and C are accessed and updated.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Temporal locality is present in the accumulation of partial results in the `acc` variable, which is reused across multiple iterations of the loop over `k`.
   - **Inter-Block Locality:** The kernel processes blocks in a manner that can lead to cache thrashing if not managed properly. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` helps align memory accesses to improve cache utilization.

3. **Potential for Cache Optimization:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By reordering the processing of blocks (swizzling), it is possible to improve cache locality. This involves changing the order in which blocks are processed to ensure that blocks that are likely to be used together are loaded into the cache simultaneously.
   - **Stride Considerations:** The kernel assumes positive strides for all matrices, which is crucial for ensuring that memory accesses are predictable and aligned.

Overall, the kernel is designed to take advantage of both spatial and temporal locality, but there is room for optimization through block swizzling and careful management of memory access patterns.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code processes blocks of matrices A, B, and C in a manner that could be optimized for better cache utilization. The goal is to improve the L2 cache hit rate by ensuring that blocks that access the same data are scheduled to the same XCD. This can be achieved by implementing a swizzling pattern that remaps the block indices to better align with the hardware's cache architecture.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the distribution of blocks across the XCDs, leading to suboptimal cache utilization. Blocks accessing the same data were not guaranteed to be scheduled on the same XCD, resulting in potential cache misses and inefficient memory access patterns."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a swizzling pattern that remaps the block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD. This is achieved by computing a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The new pattern aims to balance the workload across XCDs while maximizing data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve performance by increasing the L2 cache hit rate. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, the likelihood of cache hits is increased, reducing memory access latency. Additionally, the workload is evenly distributed across XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

Swizzling formula:
```python
    # New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    assigned_xcd = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_index = pid // NUM_XCDS
    new_pid = assigned_xcd * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS) + round_robin_index
    pid = new_pid
```

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 11.77 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 58.8% to 70.5% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.07x speedup with execution time reduced from 3.56ms to 3.33ms (7.0% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes matrix multiplication in a block-wise manner, which is beneficial for spatial locality. However, the swizzling pattern used in the previous iteration was not optimal for maximizing L2 cache utilization across the multiple XCDs available in the MI300X architecture. The goal is to improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks that access the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby reducing cache misses and improving performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used a simple round-robin assignment of blocks to XCDs, which did not fully exploit the potential for cache locality. This approach did not ensure that blocks accessing the same data were consistently mapped to the same XCD, leading to suboptimal cache utilization."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data together and assigns them to the same XCD. This is achieved by calculating a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The new pattern aims to maximize cache hits by ensuring that blocks likely to access the same data are processed on the same XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly groups blocks that access the same data and assigns them to the same XCD. This approach is expected to improve L2 cache locality by reducing the number of cache misses, as blocks that share data will be more likely to find the data already loaded in the cache. Additionally, the new pattern maintains an even distribution of work across XCDs, ensuring balanced utilization of resources.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = (pid // blocks_per_xcd) % NUM_XCDS
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = xcd_id * blocks_per_xcd + local_block_id
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 2 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 0.14 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 58.8% to 58.9% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.01x speedup with execution time reduced from 3.56ms to 3.53ms (1.1% faster).

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code is designed to perform matrix multiplication using a block-wise approach. The memory access patterns are optimized for spatial and temporal locality, but there is room for improvement in how blocks are assigned to XCDs. The previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve L2 cache locality by reordering block assignments, but they did not fully exploit the potential of the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs. A new swizzling pattern is needed to better align block assignments with the architecture's cache structure.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used a round-robin approach to assign blocks to XCDs, which improved cache locality but did not fully utilize the architecture's potential for grouping blocks that share data.",
    "iteration 2": "The swizzling pattern attempted to balance blocks across XCDs but did not effectively group blocks that access the same data, leading to minimal improvement in cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This pattern considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to ensure that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maximizing data locality. By aligning block assignments with the architecture's cache structure, the new pattern aims to improve L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly groups blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD, leveraging the shared L2 cache within each XCD. This approach is expected to enhance cache locality more effectively than previous patterns, which focused on balancing blocks without considering data access patterns. By improving data locality, the new pattern should lead to higher L2 cache hit rates and better performance.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = (pid // blocks_per_xcd) % NUM_XCDS
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = (local_block_id * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 3 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 8.20 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 58.8% to 50.6% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.03x speedup with execution time reduced from 3.56ms to 3.48ms (2.5% faster).

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code for matrix multiplication is designed to optimize memory access patterns and improve cache locality. However, the previous swizzling patterns have not fully optimized the L2 cache hit rate, as evidenced by the degradation in cache locality in the last iteration. The goal is to find a new swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache utilization.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs using a round-robin approach, which improved cache locality slightly but did not fully leverage the potential of grouping blocks accessing the same data.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern was adjusted to balance blocks more evenly across XCDs, but the improvement in cache locality was minimal, indicating that the pattern did not effectively group related blocks.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern caused a significant decrease in cache locality by disrupting the natural grouping of blocks that access the same data, leading to a lower L2 cache hit rate."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The pattern ensures that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maintaining data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This approach takes advantage of the shared L2 cache within each XCD, reducing cache misses and improving the overall cache hit rate. By maintaining an even distribution of blocks across XCDs, the pattern also ensures balanced workload distribution, which can lead to better performance.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_index = pid // NUM_XCDS
    new_pid = (round_robin_index * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 4 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 0.05 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 58.8% to 58.8% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.06x speedup with execution time reduced from 3.56ms to 3.36ms (6.2% faster).

Iteration 5:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code uses a swizzling pattern to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices to better utilize the shared L2 cache within each XCD. The goal is to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache hit rates and overall performance. The previous attempts at swizzling have shown varying degrees of success, indicating that there is still room for optimization.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not fully utilize the potential of grouping blocks that access the same data into the same XCD, leading to suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern attempted to balance blocks across XCDs but did not significantly improve data locality, resulting in minimal cache hit rate improvement.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern caused a degradation in cache locality by not effectively grouping blocks with shared data access, leading to a decrease in cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern provided a slight improvement but still did not fully optimize the grouping of blocks for shared data access within the same XCD."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data into the same XCD more effectively. This is achieved by calculating a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The pattern ensures that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maximizing data locality within each XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it more effectively groups blocks that access the same data into the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates. By considering both the original block index and the number of XCDs, the pattern ensures that blocks are evenly distributed while maximizing data locality. This should lead to improved cache utilization and overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = (pid // blocks_per_xcd) % NUM_XCDS
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = (local_block_id * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 5 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 7.74 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 58.8% to 51.0% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.02x slowdown with execution time increased from 3.56ms to 3.64ms (2.0% slower).

Iteration 6:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel implementation uses a swizzling pattern that attempts to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices. However, the previous attempts have not consistently improved cache locality, as evidenced by the fluctuating L2 cache hit rates and performance metrics. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the `streamk_gemm` kernel, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache utilization.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern improved cache locality by grouping blocks based on NUM_XCDS, but the improvement was limited due to the simplistic round-robin approach.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern attempted to balance blocks across XCDs, but the minor improvement suggests that the mapping did not fully align with the data access patterns.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern degraded cache locality by introducing a modulo operation that disrupted the natural data access sequence, leading to cache thrashing.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern slightly improved cache locality by reordering blocks, but the improvement was marginal due to insufficient alignment with data reuse patterns.",
    "iteration 5": "The pattern caused a significant degradation in cache locality by misaligning blocks with their data access patterns, leading to increased cache misses."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD more effectively. By considering the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, the pattern will ensure that blocks are assigned in a way that maximizes data reuse within each XCD's L2 cache. This approach will involve calculating the original XCD assignment and adjusting the block index to maintain balance across XCDs while enhancing data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it directly addresses the need to group blocks with similar data access patterns onto the same XCD. By doing so, it enhances the likelihood of cache hits within the L2 cache of each XCD, reducing cache misses and improving overall performance. The pattern also ensures an even distribution of blocks across XCDs, maintaining load balance and preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_index = pid // NUM_XCDS
    new_pid = (round_robin_index * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid
