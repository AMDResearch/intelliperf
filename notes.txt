Challenges:

1. concurrency
How do we know the order of operations?

For now, I am assuming free happens in the same order/sequence
and I will export IPC handle for python to do validation
then notify the interceptor to do the actual free once I got the data
or done the validation (i.e., run two apps concurrently)

Same challenge for when using pages..
are pages guaranteed to be modified in same order?
how to correlate memory pages?

2. applications have custom allocators
likely, they have a pool they manage for allocation.
Tracing alloc/free is a temp solution.
