The kernel fused_elementwise_kernel in the source code below has a low L2 cache hit rate. Please apply block swizzling to improve L2 cache locality. Do not change the semantics of the program. I need you to rewrite the entire code so I can copy it into a python file and run it.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Do not include any markdown code blocks or text other than the code. DO NOT start the code with 'python'. I want you to straight directly output the code. I want to be able to copy and paste the code into a new file and run it on the testbench without any extra work.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - Make sure to not change the kernel function signature. Do not add any new parameters to the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function. Do not change the return type of the kernel function. Do not change the name of the kernel function. Do not change the arguments of the kernel function.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - You are NOT allowed to change ANYTHING other than remapping pid directly below this line: 'pid = tl.program_id(0)' which is always at the top of the kernel. You can ONLY remap pid to pid. Do not make any changes anywhere else in the code or you will bve rejected.
