--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged for optimization:

1. **Matrix A and B Access:**
   - The kernel accesses matrices A and B in a block-wise manner, with each block being processed in chunks of `BLOCK_SIZE_K`. This access pattern is conducive to spatial locality, as contiguous memory locations are accessed within each block.

2. **Matrix C Access:**
   - The result matrix C is updated in blocks, with each block corresponding to a tile of the output matrix. This ensures that the updates to C are localized, which can improve cache efficiency.

3. **Bias Access:**
   - If bias is enabled, the bias vector is accessed in alignment with the rows of matrix A, ensuring that the bias values are reused efficiently across multiple iterations.

4. **Spatial and Temporal Locality:**
   - The kernel exhibits strong spatial locality due to the contiguous access patterns within each block. Temporal locality is achieved through the reuse of the `acc` variable, which accumulates partial results over multiple iterations.

5. **Inter-Block Locality:**
   - The processing of blocks can lead to cache thrashing if not managed properly. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` functions helps align memory accesses to improve cache utilization.

6. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Reordering the processing of blocks can enhance cache locality by ensuring that blocks likely to be used together are loaded into the cache simultaneously.
   - **Stride Management:** Ensuring positive and consistent strides for all matrices helps maintain predictable and aligned memory accesses, which is crucial for cache efficiency.

By understanding these memory access patterns and locality characteristics, it is possible to optimize the kernel for better cache performance, potentially through techniques like block swizzling and careful management of memory access patterns.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel is a matrix multiplication operation with optional bias addition, implemented using Triton. The kernel is designed to handle large matrices by dividing them into smaller blocks, which are processed in parallel. Understanding the memory access patterns and locality is crucial for optimizing performance, especially in terms of cache usage.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B Access:** The kernel accesses matrices A and B in blocks of size `BLOCK_SIZE_M x BLOCK_SIZE_K` and `BLOCK_SIZE_K x BLOCK_SIZE_N`, respectively. The access pattern is primarily determined by the loop over `k`, which iterates over the K dimension in chunks of `BLOCK_SIZE_K`.
   - **Matrix C Access:** The result matrix C is updated in blocks of size `BLOCK_SIZE_M x BLOCK_SIZE_N`. The final result is stored in C after accumulating the partial results in the `acc` variable.
   - **Bias Access:** If bias is enabled, the bias vector is accessed in a manner aligned with the rows of matrix A.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel exhibits spatial locality by accessing contiguous memory locations within each block. This is evident in the way blocks of A, B, and C are accessed and updated.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Temporal locality is present in the accumulation of partial results in the `acc` variable, which is reused across multiple iterations of the loop over `k`.
   - **Inter-Block Locality:** The kernel processes blocks in a manner that can lead to cache thrashing if not managed properly. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` helps align memory accesses to improve cache utilization.

3. **Potential for Cache Optimization:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By reordering the processing of blocks (swizzling), it is possible to improve cache locality. This involves changing the order in which blocks are processed to ensure that blocks that are likely to be used together are loaded into the cache simultaneously.
   - **Stride Considerations:** The kernel assumes positive strides for all matrices, which is crucial for ensuring that memory accesses are predictable and aligned.

Overall, the kernel is designed to take advantage of both spatial and temporal locality, but there is room for optimization through block swizzling and careful management of memory access patterns.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks of matrices A, B, and C in a manner that is conducive to spatial locality, but it does not take full advantage of the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs and their associated L2 caches. The default round-robin scheduling of blocks across XCDs can lead to suboptimal cache utilization, as blocks that access the same data may not be scheduled to the same XCD, resulting in increased cache misses and reduced performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the architecture's multiple XCDs, leading to blocks that access the same data being distributed across different XCDs. This distribution can cause cache thrashing and increased cache misses, as the L2 cache is not effectively utilized."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD. This is achieved by computing a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The goal is to maximize cache locality by ensuring that blocks likely to share data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the architecture's multiple XCDs and their L2 caches. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, the new pattern reduces cache misses and improves data locality. This leads to more efficient use of the L2 cache, resulting in better performance compared to the original pattern, which did not account for the architecture's specific characteristics.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    assigned_xcd = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_iteration = pid // NUM_XCDS
    new_pid = assigned_xcd * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS) + round_robin_iteration
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 14.07 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 49.4% to 63.5% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.03x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.85ms to 5.66ms (3.4% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks of matrices A, B, and C in a manner that can be optimized for better cache locality. The previous optimization attempt improved L2 cache hit rates by reordering the block processing sequence using a swizzling pattern. However, there is still room for improvement by exploring different swizzling strategies that better align with the memory access patterns and the architecture of the MI300X GPU.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used a simple round-robin assignment of blocks to XCDs, which improved cache locality but did not fully exploit the potential for grouping blocks that access the same data into the same XCD. This approach did not consider the specific memory access patterns of the kernel, leading to suboptimal cache utilization."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks based on their memory access patterns to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are assigned to the same XCD. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that takes into account the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, ensuring that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maximizing data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the memory access patterns of the kernel, ensuring that blocks that access the same data are more likely to be assigned to the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates by reducing cache thrashing and increasing the likelihood of cache hits, leading to better overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = (pid // blocks_per_xcd) % NUM_XCDS
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = xcd_id * blocks_per_xcd + local_block_id
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 2 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.70 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 49.4% to 48.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.00x slowdown with execution time increased from 5.85ms to 5.85ms (0.0% slower).

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code for matrix multiplication is designed to optimize memory access patterns and improve cache locality. However, the previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve L2 cache hit rates by reordering block processing, but they did not achieve the desired performance improvements. The goal is to find a new swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache locality and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs using a round-robin approach, but it did not effectively group blocks that access the same data, leading to suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 2": "The swizzling pattern used a cyclic distribution of blocks across XCDs, but it failed to consider the specific memory access patterns of the algorithm, resulting in a decrease in L2 cache hit rate and no performance improvement."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks based on their memory access patterns. By calculating the XCD id and local block id in a way that ensures blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, we aim to improve L2 cache locality. This approach considers the stride of block indexes and the number of iterations required to assign block indexes, ensuring balanced work distribution across XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to align more closely with the memory access patterns of the algorithm. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, we can improve cache locality and reduce cache thrashing. This should lead to a higher L2 cache hit rate and better overall performance compared to previous attempts, which did not adequately consider the specific memory access patterns of the algorithm.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = (pid // blocks_per_xcd) % NUM_XCDS
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = (local_block_id * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 3 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 7.26 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 49.4% to 42.1% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.02x slowdown with execution time increased from 5.85ms to 5.99ms (2.3% slower).

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current implementation of the `streamk_gemm` kernel uses a swizzling pattern that attempts to improve cache locality by reassigning block indices. However, the previous attempts have not been successful in achieving significant performance gains. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used a round-robin approach based on NUM_XCDS, which did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, leading to suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern attempted to balance blocks across XCDs but failed to consider the specific memory access patterns of the algorithm, resulting in a slight degradation in cache locality.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern used a modulo operation that disrupted the natural block ordering, causing a significant decrease in cache hit rate by scattering related blocks across different XCDs."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization strategy involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks based on their memory access patterns. By calculating the original XCD assignment and adjusting the block index to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, we aim to improve cache locality. This approach considers the stride of block indices and the number of iterations required for round-robin scheduling.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to align more closely with the memory access patterns of the `streamk_gemm` kernel. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are grouped onto the same XCD, we can improve the L2 cache hit rate. This approach should lead to better cache utilization and potentially improve the overall performance of the kernel.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    xcd_id = pid % NUM_XCDS
    round_robin_iteration = pid // NUM_XCDS
    new_pid = (round_robin_iteration * NUM_XCDS + xcd_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid

--- PROFILING ITERATION 4 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.56 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 49.4% to 48.8% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.01x slowdown with execution time increased from 5.85ms to 5.89ms (0.7% slower).

Iteration 5:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code for matrix multiplication is designed to optimize memory access patterns and improve cache locality. However, the previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve L2 cache hit rates by reordering block processing but did not achieve the desired performance improvements. The goal is to find a new swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the algorithm and the architecture of the MI300X GPU.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs using a round-robin approach, but it did not effectively group blocks that access the same data, leading to suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern tried to balance blocks across XCDs but failed to consider the data sharing between blocks, resulting in a decrease in cache locality.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern introduced a modulo operation that disrupted the natural data sharing between blocks, further degrading cache performance.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern attempted to use a round-robin approach with a modulo operation, but it did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data, leading to a slight decrease in cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This is achieved by calculating the XCD id based on the block's position within a group of blocks that share data, ensuring that these blocks are assigned to the same XCD. This approach aims to maximize cache hits by keeping related data within the same L2 cache.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it directly addresses the need to group blocks that share data onto the same XCD. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same memory are assigned to the same XCD, the pattern improves data locality and cache utilization. This should lead to a higher L2 cache hit rate and better overall performance compared to previous patterns that did not effectively group data-sharing blocks.

Swizzling formula:
# New swizzling pattern
    num_blocks = NUM_SMS
    blocks_per_xcd = num_blocks // NUM_XCDS
    group_id = pid // blocks_per_xcd
    local_block_id = pid % blocks_per_xcd
    new_pid = (group_id * NUM_XCDS + local_block_id) % num_blocks
    pid = new_pid
