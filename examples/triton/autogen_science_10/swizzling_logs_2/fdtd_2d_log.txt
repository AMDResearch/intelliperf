--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The memory access patterns in the `fdtd_2d_kernel` can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Spatial Locality:**
   - Within each block, the memory accesses for updating `hz`, `ex`, and `ey` fields are mostly contiguous along the `x` and `y` dimensions. This contiguity can be leveraged to improve cache utilization, as adjacent memory locations are likely to be loaded into the cache together.

2. **Temporal Locality:**
   - The kernel does not inherently exploit temporal locality, as each field update is independent and does not reuse data from previous iterations within the same kernel launch. However, the repeated updates over multiple iterations in the main loop can benefit from temporal locality if the data remains in the cache between iterations.

3. **Inter-Block Locality:**
   - The current block processing order may not fully exploit inter-block locality. Since each block processes a separate sub-region, the order in which blocks are processed can impact cache performance. Swizzling the block IDs to process blocks in a cache-friendly order (e.g., Z-order curve or Hilbert curve) could improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed consecutively.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The use of masks to handle boundary conditions can lead to divergent memory access patterns, especially at the edges of the grid. This divergence can reduce the effectiveness of caching, as not all threads in a warp may access memory in a coalesced manner.

To improve cache locality, consider reordering the block processing sequence to align with the natural memory layout and access patterns. This reordering can help ensure that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed in sequence, thereby improving cache hit rates and overall performance.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The Triton kernel `fdtd_2d_kernel` is designed to update the electromagnetic fields in a 2D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The kernel operates on three 2D arrays: `ex`, `ey`, and `hz`, which represent the electric and magnetic field components. The kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, where each block processes a sub-region of the 2D grid.

The memory access patterns in this kernel are primarily determined by the way the fields are updated. Each block of the kernel processes a `BLOCK_SIZE_X` by `BLOCK_SIZE_Y` sub-region of the grid. The kernel uses `tl.load` and `tl.store` operations to read from and write to the global memory. The memory access patterns can be summarized as follows:

1. **H_z Field Update:**
   - The kernel reads from `ex` and `ey` to compute the new values of `hz`.
   - The `hz` field is updated using neighboring values from `ex` and `ey`, which means that each update involves accessing adjacent memory locations in the `ex` and `ey` arrays.
   - The memory access for `hz` is contiguous along the `x` and `y` dimensions within a block, which can take advantage of spatial locality.

2. **E_x Field Update:**
   - The kernel reads from `hz` to update `ex`.
   - The update involves accessing `hz` values from the current and previous rows, which means that the memory access pattern is not fully contiguous but still exhibits some spatial locality.

3. **E_y Field Update:**
   - The kernel reads from `hz` to update `ey`.
   - Similar to the `ex` update, the `ey` update involves accessing `hz` values from the current and previous columns, which also exhibits some spatial locality.

The kernel uses masks to ensure that memory accesses are within bounds, which helps avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses but can lead to divergent memory access patterns at the edges of the grid.

Overall, the memory access patterns in this kernel exhibit spatial locality within each block due to the contiguous access of memory locations in the `x` and `y` dimensions. However, there is potential for improving cache locality by optimizing the order in which blocks are processed, especially considering the non-contiguous access patterns when updating `ex` and `ey`.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks in a straightforward manner, which may not fully exploit the cache locality available on the MI300x GPU architecture. By default, the blocks are assigned to XCDs in a round-robin fashion, which can lead to suboptimal cache utilization if blocks that access the same data are not scheduled to the same XCD. The goal is to optimize the swizzling pattern to improve L2 cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the spatial locality of data across blocks, leading to inefficient use of the L2 cache. Blocks were assigned to XCDs in a round-robin manner without regard to data sharing, resulting in potential cache misses and reduced performance."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on their spatial locality. By computing a new block index that groups blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, we can improve cache hit rates. This is achieved by calculating a new block index using a combination of the original block indices and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed together.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it takes into account the spatial locality of data across blocks. By mapping blocks that access the same data to the same XCD, we can improve the L2 cache hit rate, leading to better performance. This approach ensures that data is reused more effectively within the same XCD, reducing the need for data to be fetched from slower memory.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

num_XCD = 8
num_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
num_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
num_blocks = num_blocks_x * num_blocks_y

block_id = pid_y * num_blocks_x + pid_x
xcd_id = block_id % num_XCD
round_id = block_id // num_XCD
new_block_id = round_id * num_XCD + xcd_id

pid_m = new_block_id // num_blocks_x
pid_n = new_block_id % num_blocks_x

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 9.62 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 79.4% to 69.8% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.25x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.26ms to 0.21ms (25.5% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks in a straightforward manner, which does not take full advantage of the L2 cache locality on the MI300X architecture. The previous optimization attempt used a swizzling pattern that aimed to improve cache locality by reordering block processing. However, it resulted in a decrease in L2 cache hit rate, indicating that the swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks that access the same memory into the same XCD.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used in iteration 1 attempted to group blocks by a fixed number of XCDs, but it did not account for the specific memory access patterns of the FDTD algorithm. This led to a decrease in L2 cache hit rate because blocks that should have been processed together to maximize cache reuse were not effectively grouped, resulting in increased cache misses."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the FDTD algorithm. By considering the spatial locality of the data and the round-robin scheduling of blocks to XCDs, the new pattern will aim to group blocks that access contiguous memory regions into the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to more effectively group blocks that access contiguous memory regions into the same XCD, leveraging the spatial locality of the FDTD algorithm. By aligning the block processing order with the natural memory layout, the new pattern should improve L2 cache hit rates compared to the previous attempt, which did not adequately consider the specific memory access patterns of the algorithm.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_XCD = 8
    num_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    num_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    num_blocks = num_blocks_x * num_blocks_y

    # Calculate new block index using a different swizzling pattern
    block_id = pid_y * num_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = (block_id // num_blocks_x) % num_XCD
    new_block_id = (block_id % num_blocks_x) * num_XCD + xcd_id

    # Map new block id back to 2D grid
    pid_m = new_block_id // num_blocks_x
    pid_n = new_block_id % num_blocks_x

L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 19.70 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 79.4% to 99.1% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.69x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.26ms to 0.15ms (68.8% faster).

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code is designed to update electromagnetic fields in a 2D grid using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The main challenge is to optimize the memory access patterns to improve cache locality, particularly the L2 cache, which is crucial for performance on the MI300x GPU architecture. The previous optimizations attempted to improve cache locality by swizzling the block processing order, but there is still room for improvement by exploring different swizzling patterns that better align with the hardware's cache architecture.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern in iteration 1 did not effectively map blocks that access the same memory to the same XCD, leading to a decrease in L2 cache hit rate. The pattern was too simplistic and did not account for the round-robin scheduling of blocks across XCDs.",
    "iteration 2": "Although iteration 2 improved the L2 cache hit rate significantly, the swizzling pattern still did not fully optimize the distribution of blocks across XCDs. The pattern was better but could be further refined to ensure that blocks with high data sharing are consistently mapped to the same XCD."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a novel swizzling pattern that aims to map blocks with shared data to the same XCD more effectively. This pattern considers the round-robin scheduling of blocks and attempts to balance the load across XCDs while maximizing data locality within each XCD. The approach involves calculating a new block index that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the FDTD algorithm.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it takes into account the specific memory access patterns of the FDTD algorithm and the round-robin scheduling of blocks across XCDs. By ensuring that blocks with high data sharing are mapped to the same XCD, the pattern should improve the L2 cache hit rate and overall performance. Additionally, the pattern aims to balance the load across XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_XCD = 8

    # Calculate new block index using a novel swizzling pattern
    block_id = pid_y * num_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_XCD
    round_id = block_id // num_XCD
    new_block_id = (round_id % num_blocks_x) * num_XCD + xcd_id

    # Map new block id back to 2D grid
    pid_m = new_block_id // num_blocks_x
    pid_n = new_block_id % num_blocks_x

L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 1.90 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 79.4% to 77.5% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.29x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.26ms to 0.20ms (28.9% faster).

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current implementation of the kernel uses a swizzling pattern that attempts to improve cache locality by reordering the block processing sequence. However, the previous attempts have shown mixed results in terms of L2 cache hit rates and performance gains. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that maximizes cache utilization by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby improving the L2 cache hit rate and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, leading to a decrease in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 2": "Although the swizzling pattern improved the L2 cache hit rate significantly, it may not have fully balanced the workload across XCDs, leading to suboptimal performance.",
    "iteration 3": "The novel swizzling pattern did not maintain a high L2 cache hit rate, possibly due to an uneven distribution of blocks across XCDs or insufficient grouping of data-sharing blocks."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to better align the block processing order with the natural memory layout and access patterns. By calculating a new block index that considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, the pattern ensures that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache locality and performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This approach should improve the L2 cache hit rate by maximizing data reuse within the same XCD, leading to better cache locality and overall performance.

L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 9.70 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 79.4% to 69.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.27x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.26ms to 0.21ms (26.7% faster).

Iteration 5:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks in a straightforward manner, which does not take full advantage of the GPU's architecture, particularly the multiple XCDs with their own L2 caches. The previous optimizations attempted to improve cache locality by reordering block processing, but they did not fully optimize the swizzling pattern to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively map blocks accessing the same data to the same XCD, leading to a decrease in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 2": "Although there was an improvement in cache locality, the pattern was not optimal for all data access patterns, leading to uneven performance gains.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern caused a slight degradation in cache locality, as it did not consistently map related blocks to the same XCD.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern led to a significant decrease in cache hit rate, as it failed to maintain data locality across XCDs effectively."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to map blocks accessing the same data to the same XCD more effectively. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the round-robin assignment of blocks to XCDs and ensures that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed together.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve performance by better aligning the block processing order with the GPU's architecture. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, the L2 cache hit rate should increase, leading to better cache utilization and overall performance improvements.

Swizzling formula:

Iteration 6:
Code optimization reasoning:
The previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve cache locality by reordering the block processing sequence. However, they did not fully exploit the architecture's potential for cache sharing among blocks that access the same data. The goal is to ensure that blocks accessing the same memory are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD while ensuring an even distribution of workload across all XCDs. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers both the original block index and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks are assigned to XCDs in a manner that maximizes cache sharing and utilization.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the architecture's XCD structure, aiming to group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates by ensuring that data is more likely to be found in the cache when accessed by subsequent blocks. Additionally, the pattern ensures an even distribution of blocks across XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

The new optimization involves a novel swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD while ensuring an even distribution of workload across all XCDs. This pattern is designed to improve L2 cache hit rates by maximizing data locality and cache utilization.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the distribution of blocks across XCDs, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are grouped together. This should lead to improved L2 cache hit rates by reducing cache misses and increasing data reuse within the same XCD. Additionally, the even distribution of workload across XCDs should prevent underutilization and improve overall performance.

Iteration 8:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code for the 2D FDTD simulation is designed to update electromagnetic fields on a grid. The memory access patterns are mostly contiguous within each block, which is beneficial for spatial locality. However, the inter-block locality is not fully optimized, as the default block processing order does not ensure that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed consecutively. This can lead to suboptimal cache utilization, particularly in the L2 cache, which is shared among multiple compute units (CUs) within the same XCD on the MI300x GPU architecture.

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same memory into the same XCD more effectively. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks. The goal is to ensure that blocks with spatially adjacent data are processed in sequence, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:

By reassigning block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same memory are grouped into the same XCD, the new pattern should improve L2 cache locality. This should lead to higher cache hit rates and better performance compared to previous iterations, which did not fully optimize the block assignment to XCDs.

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a novel swizzling pattern that aims to better align block processing with the natural memory layout. By calculating a new block index that considers both the round-robin scheduling of XCDs and the spatial locality of data, the pattern seeks to improve L2 cache hit rates by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are processed on the same XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it takes into account the round-robin scheduling of XCDs and attempts to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This approach should improve L2 cache hit rates by reducing cache misses and ensuring that data is reused more effectively within the same XCD. By balancing the workload across XCDs while maintaining data locality, the new pattern aims to achieve better performance than previous iterations.

Hit rate increased from 79.4% to 87.6% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.09x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.26ms to 0.24ms (8.9% faster).

Iteration 10:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current swizzling pattern attempts to improve cache locality by reassigning block indices to better align with the memory access patterns. However, the previous attempts have shown mixed results, with some iterations improving cache locality and others degrading it. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that consistently improves L2 cache hit rates by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby maximizing cache utilization.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data, leading to a decrease in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern improved cache locality by better aligning block processing with memory access patterns.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern failed to maintain improved cache locality, resulting in a slight degradation.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern caused significant cache locality degradation due to ineffective block grouping.",
    "iteration 5": "The pattern did not improve cache locality, leading to a decrease in hit rate.",
    "iteration 6": "The pattern continued to degrade cache locality, similar to previous iterations.",
    "iteration 7": "The pattern improved cache locality by better grouping blocks accessing the same data.",
    "iteration 8": "The pattern caused a decrease in cache locality, similar to earlier unsuccessful attempts.",
    "iteration 9": "The pattern improved cache locality by effectively grouping blocks accessing the same data."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on a combination of round-robin scheduling and data access patterns. The goal is to map blocks that access the same data to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, ensuring balanced work distribution across XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This approach aims to maximize cache utilization by improving data locality, which should lead to higher L2 cache hit rates and better performance compared to previous patterns that did not consistently achieve these goals.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_XCD = 8
    num_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    num_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    num_blocks = num_blocks_x * num_blocks_y

    # Calculate new block index using a new swizzling pattern
    block_id = pid_y * num_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_XCD
    round_id = block_id // num_XCD
    new_block_id = (round_id * num_XCD + xcd_id) % num_blocks

    # Map new block id back to 2D grid
    pid_m = new_block_id // num_blocks_x
    pid_n = new_block_id % num_blocks_x
