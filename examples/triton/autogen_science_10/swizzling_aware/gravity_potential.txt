--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `gravity_potential_kernel` exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged for optimization:

1. **Grid Memory Access:**
   - The grid points are accessed in a block-wise manner using `offsets_x` and `offsets_y`, which ensures that each block of threads works on a distinct, contiguous section of the grid. This pattern is conducive to good spatial locality, as contiguous memory accesses are likely to be cached efficiently.

2. **Masses and Positions Access:**
   - The masses and their positions are accessed in a loop, with each mass and its corresponding position being loaded from memory. The positions are accessed in a strided manner, which can be efficient if the data is stored contiguously. However, since each mass is accessed once per grid point calculation, there is limited temporal locality.

3. **Cache Locality:**
   - The kernel benefits from spatial locality within each block due to contiguous access patterns. Temporal locality is limited, but repeated access to the same mass and position within a block can still benefit from caching.
   - The use of masks to store results only within valid grid boundaries helps reduce unnecessary memory writes, enhancing cache efficiency.

4. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Adjusting the block ID mapping to ensure that spatially close blocks in the grid are also close in memory can improve cache performance.
   - **Data Layout:** Ensuring contiguous and aligned storage of masses and positions can improve the efficiency of memory loads.

By understanding these patterns, you can explore optimizations such as block swizzling and data layout adjustments to enhance cache locality and overall performance.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The kernel `gravity_potential_kernel` is designed to compute the gravitational potential at grid points due to a set of masses. The memory access patterns and locality are crucial for optimizing performance, especially in a parallel computing environment like Triton.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Grid Points:** The grid points are accessed using `offsets_x` and `offsets_y`, which are calculated based on the block IDs (`pid_x` and `pid_y`) and the block sizes (`BLOCK_SIZE_X` and `BLOCK_SIZE_Y`). This ensures that each block of threads works on a distinct section of the grid, minimizing overlap and contention.
   - **Masses and Positions:** The masses and their positions are accessed in a loop over `n_masses`. Each mass and its position are loaded from memory using `tl.load`. The positions are accessed in a strided manner, with `mass_x` and `mass_y` being loaded from consecutive memory locations. This pattern is efficient if the data is stored contiguously in memory.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel exhibits spatial locality in accessing the grid points. Each block of threads accesses a contiguous block of grid points, which is beneficial for cache utilization. The use of `offsets_x` and `offsets_y` ensures that memory accesses are aligned and contiguous within each block.
   - **Temporal Locality:** There is limited temporal locality in accessing the masses and positions, as each mass is accessed once per grid point calculation. However, the repeated access to the same mass and position within a block can benefit from caching if the data fits in the cache.
   - **Cache Utilization:** The use of masks to store results only within valid grid boundaries helps in reducing unnecessary memory writes, which can improve cache efficiency.

3. **Potential for Optimization:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By adjusting the block ID mapping (swizzling), it may be possible to improve cache locality further. For example, ensuring that blocks that are spatially close in the grid are also close in memory can enhance cache performance.
   - **Data Layout:** Ensuring that the masses and positions are stored contiguously and aligned in memory can improve the efficiency of `tl.load` operations.

Overall, the kernel is structured to take advantage of spatial locality within each block, but there may be opportunities to improve inter-block locality through block swizzling and data layout optimizations.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code calculates the gravitational potential at grid points due to a set of masses. The kernel uses a block-wise approach to process grid points, which is beneficial for spatial locality. However, the access pattern for masses and positions is not optimized for cache locality, as each mass is accessed once per grid point calculation, leading to limited temporal locality. The goal is to optimize the swizzling pattern to improve cache performance by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby enhancing L2 cache hit rates.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the distribution of blocks across XCDs, leading to suboptimal cache utilization. Blocks accessing the same data were not necessarily mapped to the same XCD, resulting in poor L2 cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This is achieved by computing a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The swizzling pattern aims to balance the workload across XCDs while maximizing cache locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve performance by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby increasing the likelihood of cache hits in the shared L2 cache. This approach leverages the architecture's round-robin scheduling to maintain balanced workload distribution while enhancing data locality.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_xcds = 8
    total_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    total_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    total_blocks = total_blocks_x * total_blocks_y

    block_id = pid_y * total_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = round_id + xcd_id * (total_blocks // num_xcds)

    pid_x = new_block_id % total_blocks_x
    pid_y = new_block_id // total_blocks_x

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.03 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 87.7% to 87.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.02x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.50ms to 5.41ms (1.6% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code calculates gravitational potential at grid points based on the positions and masses of objects. The memory access pattern is block-wise, which is generally good for spatial locality. However, the previous swizzling pattern did not significantly improve L2 cache locality, as indicated by the minimal change in cache hit rate. The goal is to optimize the swizzling pattern to better utilize the L2 cache by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs based on a calculated new block index. However, it did not effectively group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD, leading to minimal improvement in L2 cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, ensuring that data-sharing blocks are grouped together.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This grouping allows for better utilization of the L2 cache, as data accessed by one block is more likely to be in the cache when accessed by another block on the same XCD. This should lead to a higher L2 cache hit rate and improved performance.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_xcds = 8
    total_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    total_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    total_blocks = total_blocks_x * total_blocks_y

    block_id = pid_y * total_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = (round_id % (total_blocks // num_xcds)) * num_xcds + xcd_id

    pid_x = new_block_id % total_blocks_x
    pid_y = new_block_id // total_blocks_x

--- PROFILING ITERATION 2 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.04 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 87.7% to 87.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.02x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.50ms to 5.41ms (1.6% faster).

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The goal is to optimize the GPU kernel by improving L2 cache locality through a new swizzling pattern. The previous attempts at swizzling did not significantly improve cache locality, as indicated by the minimal changes in L2 cache hit rates. The task is to devise a new swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache utilization.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, leading to suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 2": "The revised swizzling pattern still failed to significantly improve cache locality, as it did not adequately consider the stride and distribution of blocks across XCDs."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on a more sophisticated understanding of the block distribution and memory access patterns. The pattern aims to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to more effectively group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD. By considering the stride and distribution of blocks, the pattern aims to enhance cache locality and balance the workload across XCDs, leading to better cache utilization and improved performance.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_xcds = 8
    total_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    total_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    total_blocks = total_blocks_x * total_blocks_y

    block_id = pid_y * total_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = (round_id * num_xcds + xcd_id) % total_blocks

    pid_x = new_block_id % total_blocks_x
    pid_y = new_block_id // total_blocks_x

--- PROFILING ITERATION 3 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.07 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 87.7% to 87.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.00x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.50ms to 5.47ms (0.5% faster).

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve cache locality by reordering the block execution to better utilize the L2 cache on the MI300X architecture. However, these patterns did not significantly improve the L2 cache hit rate, indicating that the swizzling did not effectively group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD. A new approach is needed to better align the block execution with the memory access patterns of the kernel.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, leading to minimal improvement in cache locality.",
    "iteration 2": "The modified swizzling pattern still failed to align block execution with memory access patterns, resulting in no significant change in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs but did not account for the specific data access patterns of the kernel, leading to negligible performance gains."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD more effectively. This will be achieved by calculating a new block index that considers both the original block index and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks with similar data access patterns are executed on the same XCD. This approach aims to improve L2 cache locality by maximizing data reuse within each XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to better align with the memory access patterns of the kernel by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are executed on the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates by increasing data reuse within each XCD, leading to better overall performance compared to previous attempts that did not effectively group data-sharing blocks.

    total_blocks = total_blocks_x * total_blocks_y

    block_id = pid_y * total_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = (block_id // num_xcds) + (block_id % num_xcds) * (total_blocks // num_xcds)

    pid_x = new_block_id % total_blocks_x
    pid_y = new_block_id // total_blocks_x

--- PROFILING ITERATION 4 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.03 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 87.7% to 87.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.02x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.50ms to 5.41ms (1.6% faster).

    "iteration 2": "The new swizzling pattern still failed to align blocks with shared data access to the same XCD, resulting in negligible cache locality improvement.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern did not adequately consider the stride of block indexes, leading to poor data locality across XCDs.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern did not effectively balance the workload across XCDs while ensuring that blocks accessing the same data were grouped together."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on a combination of their original indices and the number of XCDs. This pattern aims to group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD, while also balancing the workload across all XCDs. The approach considers the stride of block indexes and the number of iterations required for round-robin scheduling.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the memory access patterns of the algorithm and the architecture of the MI300X GPU. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, the pattern improves L2 cache locality. Additionally, the pattern balances the workload across XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    num_xcds = 8

    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = (round_id * num_xcds + xcd_id) % total_blocks

Iteration 6:
Code optimization reasoning:
The previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve cache locality by reassigning block indices in a way that was intended to keep blocks that access the same data on the same XCD. However, these patterns did not significantly improve the L2 cache hit rate, indicating that the reassignment did not effectively group blocks with shared data access. The goal is to find a new swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the kernel to improve cache locality and performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data, leading to minimal improvement in cache locality.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern attempted to reorder blocks but did not significantly change the data sharing across XCDs, resulting in negligible cache hit rate improvement.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern used a modulo operation that did not align well with the memory access patterns, failing to improve cache locality.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern was similar to previous attempts and did not address the core issue of data sharing across XCDs.",
    "iteration 5": "The pattern reverted to a previous form that had already shown limited effectiveness in improving cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on a combination of the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. This pattern aims to group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD, thereby improving cache locality and performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to more effectively group blocks that share data onto the same XCD, which should improve the L2 cache hit rate.

This is achieved by computing a new block index that better aligns with the round-robin scheduling of XCDs, ensuring that blocks with shared data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the round-robin scheduling of XCDs and the need to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. By calculating a new block index that aligns with these requirements, the pattern is expected to improve L2 cache locality, leading to better performance. This approach is different from previous attempts, which did not adequately address the need for data-sharing blocks to be scheduled on the same XCD.

The previous swizzling patterns attempted to improve cache locality by reordering the block execution to better utilize the L2 cache on the MI300X GPU. However, these patterns did not significantly improve the L2 cache hit rate, indicating that the swizzling did not effectively group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD. A new approach is needed to better align the block execution with the memory access patterns of the kernel.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD, leading to minimal improvement in cache locality.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern attempted to reorder blocks but still failed to align with the memory access patterns, resulting in negligible cache locality improvement.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern was not optimal for the specific memory access patterns of the kernel, leading to a decrease in cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern did not adequately balance the workload across XCDs, resulting in suboptimal cache utilization.",
    "iteration 5": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively map blocks to XCDs based on shared data access, leading to poor cache performance.",
    "iteration 6": "The pattern failed to group blocks with shared data access onto the same XCD, resulting in decreased cache locality.",
    "iteration 7": "The swizzling pattern did not align well with the kernel's memory access patterns, leading to a decrease in cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 8": "The pattern did not effectively utilize the L2 cache by grouping blocks with shared data access onto the same XCD.",
    "iteration 9": "The swizzling pattern did not improve cache locality as it failed to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD more effectively. This is achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The new pattern ensures that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD, improving cache locality and performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to better align with the kernel's memory access patterns by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are grouped onto the same XCD. This should improve the L2 cache hit rate by reducing the number of cache misses and improving data reuse within the same XCD. Additionally, the pattern aims to balance the workload across XCDs, ensuring efficient utilization of the GPU's resources.

Swizzling formula:
pid_x = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_y = tl.program_id(1)

    # New Swizzling pattern
    num_xcds = 8
    total_blocks_x = (Nx + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_X
    total_blocks_y = (Ny + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_Y
    total_blocks = total_blocks_x * total_blocks_y

    # Calculate new block index
    block_id = pid_y * total_blocks_x + pid_x
    xcd_id = block_id % num_xcds
    round_id = block_id // num_xcds
    new_block_id = (xcd_id * (total_blocks // num_xcds) + round_id) % total_blocks

    # Map new block index back to 2D grid
    pid_x = new_block_id % total_blocks_x
    pid_y = new_block_id // total_blocks_x
