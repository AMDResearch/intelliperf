--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The memory access patterns in the `smith_waterman_kernel` are characterized by block-based processing, sequential access within blocks, and stride-based access for the score matrix. Each block processes a sub-matrix of the score matrix, accessing sequence data and scores in a contiguous manner, which is beneficial for cache locality. The use of masks ensures boundary conditions are respected, preventing invalid memory accesses.

To improve memory locality, especially between blocks, consider swizzling the block ids (`pid_m` and `pid_n`) to follow a space-filling curve like a Z-order or Hilbert curve. This can enhance spatial locality by ensuring that blocks that are close in the problem space are also close in memory, reducing cache misses and improving performance.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The kernel is designed to perform a Smith-Waterman alignment on two sequences, `seq1` and `seq2`. The memory access patterns are primarily determined by how the sequences and the score matrix are accessed and stored. The kernel uses a block-based approach, where each block processes a sub-matrix of the score matrix. The key aspects of memory access patterns and locality are as follows:

1. **Block-Based Access**: The kernel divides the work into blocks of size `BLOCK_SIZE_M` by `BLOCK_SIZE_N`. Each block is responsible for computing a sub-matrix of the score matrix. This block-based approach is beneficial for cache locality because it allows each block to work on a contiguous section of memory, reducing cache misses.

2. **Sequential Access within Blocks**: Within each block, the kernel accesses the sequence data and score matrix in a sequential manner. This is evident from the use of `tl.arange` to generate offsets for loading sequence fragments and storing scores. Sequential access patterns are generally cache-friendly because they allow prefetching and reduce cache line evictions.

3. **Masking for Boundary Conditions**: The use of masks (`mask_m` and `mask_n`) ensures that the kernel does not access memory outside the bounds of the sequences. This is important for avoiding invalid memory accesses and potential cache pollution with unnecessary data.

4. **Stride-Based Access for Scores**: The score matrix is accessed using strides (`stride_m` and `stride_n`), which determine how the scores are laid out in memory. Proper choice of strides can enhance cache locality by ensuring that scores computed by adjacent blocks are stored in nearby memory locations.

5. **Potential for Swizzling**: The current block id assignment (`pid_m` and `pid_n`) is straightforward, but there is potential to swizzle these ids to improve cache locality. For example, a Z-order curve or Hilbert curve could be used to assign block ids in a way that maximizes spatial locality, especially when the sequences are large and the score matrix does not fit entirely in cache.

Overall, the kernel exhibits good memory locality within blocks due to sequential access patterns and block-based processing. However, there is room for improvement in inter-block locality, which could be achieved by reordering block ids to better align with the hardware cache architecture.

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks of sequence data and scores them using a block-based approach. The memory access pattern is sequential within blocks, which is good for cache locality. However, the inter-block memory access pattern could be improved by swizzling the block IDs to enhance spatial locality and better utilize the L2 cache on the MI300X architecture. The goal is to map blocks that access the same data to the same XCD, thereby improving cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs and their separate L2 caches. Blocks were assigned in a straightforward manner without optimizing for cache locality across XCDs, leading to potential cache misses and suboptimal performance."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on their original mapping to XCDs. By computing the XCD ID and adjusting the block index accordingly, we ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This approach balances the workload across XCDs while maximizing cache locality, leading to improved performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern takes into account the architecture of the MI300X GPU, specifically its multiple XCDs and their associated L2 caches. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, we improve cache hit rates and reduce memory access latency. This approach is more efficient than the original pattern, which did not consider the architecture's specific characteristics.

Swizzling formula:
pid_m = tl.program_id(0)
pid_n = tl.program_id(1)

num_xcds = 8
num_blocks_m = (M + BLOCK_SIZE_M - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_M
num_blocks_n = (N + BLOCK_SIZE_N - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_N
total_blocks = num_blocks_m * num_blocks_n

xcd_id_m = (pid_m * num_xcds) // num_blocks_m
xcd_id_n = (pid_n * num_xcds) // num_blocks_n

new_pid_m = (pid_m % (num_blocks_m // num_xcds)) * num_xcds + xcd_id_m
new_pid_n = (pid_n % (num_blocks_n // num_xcds)) * num_xcds + xcd_id_n

pid_m = new_pid_m
pid_n = new_pid_n

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.19 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 50.9% to 50.7% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.16x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.07ms to 0.06ms (15.8% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code processes blocks of sequence data and scores in a contiguous manner, which is generally beneficial for cache locality. However, the previous swizzling pattern attempted to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices based on a fixed number of XCDs, which did not effectively enhance cache performance. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the memory access patterns of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache hits.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used a simple modulo and division approach to reassign block indices, which did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This led to a slight decrease in L2 cache hit rate, as the pattern did not align well with the memory access patterns of the algorithm."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern based on a space-filling curve, specifically a Z-order curve, to improve spatial locality. This approach will ensure that blocks that are close in the problem space are also close in memory, which should enhance cache performance by reducing cache misses.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern based on a Z-order curve is expected to be better because it more effectively groups blocks that access contiguous memory regions, thereby improving cache locality. This pattern aligns better with the memory access patterns of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, ensuring that blocks accessing the same or nearby data are mapped to the same XCD, which should increase the L2 cache hit rate and overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
pid_m = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_n = tl.program_id(1)

    # Swizzling pattern using Z-order curve
    num_xcds = 8
    num_blocks_m = (M + BLOCK_SIZE_M - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_M
    num_blocks_n = (N + BLOCK_SIZE_N - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_N

    # Calculate Morton code (Z-order curve)
    def interleave_bits(x, y):
        z = 0
        for i in range(max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length())):
            z |= ((x >> i) & 1) << (2 * i)
            z |= ((y >> i) & 1) << (2 * i + 1)
        return z

    morton_code = interleave_bits(pid_m, pid_n)
    new_pid = morton_code % (num_blocks_m * num_blocks_n)

    # Map new_pid to 2D grid
    pid_m = new_pid // num_blocks_n
    pid_n = new_pid % num_blocks_n

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original code processes blocks of a matrix in a straightforward manner, which can lead to suboptimal cache usage due to the default round-robin scheduling of blocks across XCDs. The goal is to improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thereby reducing cache misses and improving performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs using a simple modulo operation, which did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD. This led to a slight decrease in L2 cache hit rate, as the pattern did not align well with the data access patterns of the algorithm."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will use a diagonal swizzling pattern to map blocks to XCDs. This pattern will ensure that blocks that are close in the problem space are also close in memory, improving cache locality. By mapping blocks diagonally, we can better align the data access patterns with the XCDs' cache, potentially increasing the L2 cache hit rate.

Reason why new should be better:
The diagonal swizzling pattern should be better because it aligns more closely with the natural data access patterns of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. By mapping blocks diagonally, we can ensure that blocks that access similar data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD, thus improving cache locality and reducing cache misses compared to the previous modulo-based approach.

Swizzling formula:
pid_m = tl.program_id(0)
    pid_n = tl.program_id(1)

    # Diagonal swizzling pattern
    num_xcds = 8
    num_blocks_m = (M + BLOCK_SIZE_M - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_M
    num_blocks_n = (N + BLOCK_SIZE_N - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_N

    # Calculate diagonal index
    diag_index = pid_m + pid_n
    new_pid_m = diag_index % num_blocks_m
    new_pid_n = (diag_index // num_blocks_m) % num_blocks_n

    pid_m = new_pid_m
    pid_n = new_pid_n

--- PROFILING ITERATION 3 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 3.80 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 50.9% to 54.7% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.35x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.07ms to 0.05ms (35.5% faster).

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The goal is to optimize the memory access pattern of the Smith-Waterman kernel to improve L2 cache locality by using a new swizzling pattern. The previous attempts used different swizzling strategies, such as a diagonal pattern and a Z-order curve, but there is still room for improvement. The MI300X GPU architecture has multiple XCDs, each with its own L2 cache, and the aim is to map blocks that access the same data to the same XCD to maximize cache hits.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs using a simple modulo operation, which did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data, leading to suboptimal cache locality.",
    "iteration 3": "The diagonal swizzling pattern improved cache locality by grouping blocks along diagonals, but it did not fully exploit the potential of the L2 cache by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data were consistently mapped to the same XCD."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will use a block grouping strategy based on the round-robin scheduling of XCDs. By calculating the original XCD assignment and adjusting the block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, we can improve cache locality. This approach will consider the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to balance the workload across XCDs while maximizing data reuse within each XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it directly addresses the need to map blocks that access the same data to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hits. By understanding the round-robin scheduling and adjusting block indices accordingly, the new pattern ensures that data reuse is maximized within each XCD, leading to better cache locality and potentially higher performance.

Swizzling formula:
pid_m = tl.program_id(0)
pid_n = tl.program_id(1)

num_xcds = 8
num_blocks_m = (M + BLOCK_SIZE_M - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_M
num_blocks_n = (N + BLOCK_SIZE_N - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_N
total_blocks = num_blocks_m * num_blocks_n

original_xcd_m = pid_m % num_xcds
original_xcd_n = pid_n % num_xcds

new_pid_m = (pid_m // num_xcds) * num_xcds + original_xcd_m
new_pid_n = (pid_n // num_xcds) * num_xcds + original_xcd_n

pid_m = new_pid_m
pid_n = new_pid_n

--- PROFILING ITERATION 4 ---
L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.00 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 50.9% to 50.9% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.01x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.07ms to 0.07ms (1.0% faster).

Iteration 5:
Code optimization reasoning:
The goal is to optimize the swizzling pattern to improve L2 cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This can be achieved by reassigning block indices in a way that groups data-accessing blocks together, taking into account the round-robin scheduling of blocks across XCDs.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to group blocks using a fixed number of XCDs, but it did not effectively consider the round-robin scheduling, leading to suboptimal cache locality.",
    "iteration 3": "The diagonal swizzling pattern improved cache locality by grouping blocks along diagonals, but it did not fully utilize the round-robin scheduling to maximize cache hits.",
    "iteration 4": "The pattern attempted to group blocks by their original XCD assignment, but it did not effectively balance the workload across XCDs, resulting in no improvement in cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on their original XCD assignment and the round-robin scheduling. This pattern aims to group blocks that access the same data onto the same XCD, while also balancing the workload across all XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it takes into account both the original XCD assignment and the round-robin scheduling. By doing so, it ensures that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be mapped to the same XCD, improving cache locality and balancing the workload across XCDs.

    total_blocks = num_blocks_m * num_blocks_n

    assigned_xcd_m = pid_m % num_xcds
    assigned_xcd_n = pid_n % num_xcds

    pid_m = new_pid_m
    pid_n = new_pid_n

--- PROFILING ITERATION 5 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 0.00 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 50.9% to 50.9% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.06x slowdown with execution time increased from 0.07ms to 0.07ms (5.5% slower).

Iteration 6:
Code optimization reasoning:
The goal is to optimize the GPU kernel code by improving L2 cache locality through a new swizzling pattern. The previous attempts have shown varying degrees of success, but none have maximized performance. The MI300x GPU architecture, with its multiple XCDs and associated L2 caches, requires a swizzling pattern that ensures blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This will improve cache hits and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to group blocks using a fixed number of XCDs, but it did not effectively map blocks accessing the same data to the same XCD, leading to a slight decrease in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 3": "The diagonal swizzling pattern improved cache locality by grouping blocks along diagonals, but it did not fully utilize the XCDs' cache sharing potential.",
    "iteration 4": "The new swizzling pattern attempted to group blocks by their original XCD assignment, but it did not improve cache locality, as evidenced by no change in the L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 5": "The round-robin assignment of blocks to XCDs did not effectively group data-sharing blocks, resulting in no improvement in cache locality and a slight performance slowdown."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that groups blocks based on their data access patterns, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This will be achieved by calculating a new block index that considers the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks, ensuring balanced work distribution across XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it directly addresses the need to map blocks accessing the same data to the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache locality. By considering the data access patterns and the architecture's round-robin scheduling, the new pattern aims to maximize cache hits and balance the workload across XCDs, leading to improved performance.

L2 Cache Locality Degradation: L2 cache hit rate decreased by 0.00 percentage points. Hit rate decreased from 50.9% to 50.9% (lower percentages indicate worse cache locality). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.01x speedup with execution time reduced from 0.07ms to 0.07ms (1.1% faster).

Iteration 7:
Code optimization reasoning:
The goal is to optimize the GPU kernel code by applying a swizzling pattern that improves L2 cache locality. The previous attempts at swizzling have not fully maximized the performance potential, as indicated by the profiling reports. The task is to devise a new swizzling pattern that ensures blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data to the same XCD, leading to a slight decrease in L2 cache hit rate.",
    "iteration 3": "The diagonal swizzling pattern improved cache locality but did not fully optimize the block distribution across XCDs.",
    "iteration 4": "The new swizzling pattern did not change the L2 cache hit rate, indicating that it did not effectively improve data locality.",

}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on a combination of their original positions and a calculated offset. This offset is determined by the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are grouped together on the same XCD. This approach aims to improve L2 cache locality by maximizing data reuse within each XCD.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the distribution of blocks across XCDs, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be mapped to the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates by enhancing data locality, as blocks that share data will be closer in memory. Additionally, the pattern aims to balance the workload across XCDs, preventing any single XCD from becoming a bottleneck.

The goal is to optimize the GPU kernel code by applying a swizzling pattern that improves L2 cache locality. The previous attempts at swizzling have shown mixed results, with some patterns improving cache locality and others degrading it.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are grouped together.
